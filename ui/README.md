# Openlibrary


## Prerequisites
 - NodeJs : https://nodejs.org/en/download/
 - Angular CLI - npm install -g @angular/cli


## Development server

Run `ng serve` for a dev server. Navigate to `http://localhost:4200/`. The application will automatically reload if you change any of the source files.

## Code scaffolding

Run `ng generate component component-name` to generate a new component. You can also use `ng generate directive|pipe|service|class|guard|interface|enum|module`.

## Build

Run `ng build` to build the project. The build artifacts will be stored in the `dist/` directory.

## Notes

1. Architecture: Angular follows a component-based architecture, which allows developers to build reusable and modular UI components. Components are the building blocks of an Angular application and each component consists of a template, a class, and metadata.
2. TypeScript: Angular is built using TypeScript, a superset of JavaScript that adds features such as strong typing, interfaces, and classes to JavaScript. TypeScript allows developers to catch errors at compile time, which can improve the quality of code and save time in debugging.
3. Directives: Angular provides several built-in directives that enable developers to add dynamic behavior to their templates. Directives are instructions that tell Angular how to manipulate the DOM. Some of the commonly used directives in Angular are ngIf, ngFor, ngClass, and ngStyle.
4. Services: Services in Angular are used to share data and functionality across different components in an application. Services are typically used to retrieve data from a backend API or to perform other operations that are not related to a specific component.
5. Dependency Injection: Angular uses dependency injection (DI) to manage the dependencies of an application. DI is a design pattern that allows developers to create loosely coupled components that can be easily maintained and tested.
6. Routing: Angular provides a powerful routing module that allows developers to create routes for their application. Routes are defined in the app-routing.module.ts file and can be used to navigate between different views of an application.
